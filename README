What will we cover? 
===================

We are going to build an app together with the following functionality: 
- consume a stream of tweets 
- filter tweets with a specific tag 
- persist matched tweets in redis 
- open a new stream with matched elements 
- display elements using websockets


How will this work? 
===================

At the beginning of the workshop we will form 5 groups. 
Each group will have an instructor who would help folks to get started with Play/Scala. 
Then groups will simply hack away.
